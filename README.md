## Intro

PingFast is a program to help the average user test and optimize their connection for the lowest possible ping, performing these changes manually requires a series of registry entries and some of these changes take effect after a major windows update. With that in mind, the program was developed to make the user's life easier. </p>

Currently, the program is only offered in Brazilian Portuguese, but an English version is planned for the near future. </p>

The source of this project is not available for security reasons, Login and VPN should appear in future versions </p>
