## Intro

PingFast is a program to help the average user test and optimize their connection for the lowest possible ping, performing these changes manually requires a series of registry entries and some of these changes take effect after a major windows update. With that in mind, the program was developed to make the user's life easier.

## Current Functions

- Change network settings to reduce latency
- Restore network settings to Windows default
- Advanved Settings to customize your config
- Check if the settings are applied and notify the user
- Test ping at 0.5s intervals (By default windows tests every 1s)
- Option to save report
- Customizable number of shots with consistent progress bar
- Change DNS
- Swap DNS CACHE
- Test UDP and TCP ports
- Check NAT type

## Minimum requirements

- Microsoft Windows 7+ (Some changes have no effect on pre-Win10 systems)
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 (Already included in Win 10+)
